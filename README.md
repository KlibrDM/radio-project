# radio-project
Live preview: klibrdm.github.io/radio-project/

radio-project was made as a project for university. The project had to be made with HTML, CSS and Javascript (+jQuery) so that brought some limitations. The data is stored in JSON files, while it works once you've set it up, it's a really tedious job to get everything ready. Follow the steps in **Setup** to get it running and then open `js/config.js`. You will find more details there.

## Setup
* Clone the repository into your apache web root folder
* Open `js/config.js` and make sure you have all the settings right
* Modify the files inside `data` and `img` folders to your needs
* Make sure apache is running
* Access it through `localhost` or another hostname that you've set up
## Limitations and bugs
* Data is stored in JSON files. Right now, the data has to be manually inserted
* Translation won't translate some elements if the browser lags behind
* You will have to dabble with the code if you want to modify the pages as they are mostly hardcoded
